WHAT'S THIS THEN?
=================

Collecting sacrilegious coding humor to fuel a Twitter bot.

If you want to submit a verse, add it to `scripture.txt`.

If you'd like to add a book that it may come from, add that to `books.txt`.

All submissions should be on new lines with a linebreak after them.

Thanks and may PC be upon you.

LEGALISHY STUFF
===============

If you submit something, you have to have the right to submit it and you have to be OK with me using it to power a Twitter bot some time in the future.

No suing me.

CONTRIBUTE
==========

You want to contribute? Awesome!

Clone the project, add your scripture(s) and/or book(s) and then submit a PR.
