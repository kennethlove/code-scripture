And the Scrummaster said, the developer shall go up: behold, I have delivered the user stories into the board.
And in their terminal Git shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou stash thy commits against a repo.
Therefore being justified by tests, we have peace with merges.
Thou shall obey the 0b1010 commandments.
You shall have no other branchs before Master.
You shall not make bugs.
You shall not take the name of the Linus your BDFL in vain.
Remember the Epoch day, to keep it holy.
Honor your HEAD and your HEAD.
You shall not rm -rf /.
You shall not commit redundancy.
You shall not buffer overflow.
You shall not bear false witness against your tests.
You shall contribute to OSS.
