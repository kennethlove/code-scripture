And the Scrummaster said, the developer shall go up: behold, I have delivered the user stories into the board.
And in their terminal Git shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou stash thy commits against a repo.
Therefore being justified by tests, we have peace with merges.
And why ye call me, function, and do not the things which I say?
Code that is untested, let it be untested still: and that which is repetitious, let it be repetitious still: and that code that is DRY, let it be DRY still: and it that is merged, let it be merged still.
I am [0] and [-1], the beginning and the end, the first and the last
And thou shalt love the maintainers thy salvation with all thine pull requests, and with all thy feature requests, and with all thy patience
For it is not ye that teach, but the Spirit of the Docs which teacheth in you
And whoso shall mentor one such newbie committer in my name mentoreth me
If any dev rebase the branch of master, she shall branch destroy; for the branch of master is holy
