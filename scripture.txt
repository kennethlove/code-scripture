And the Scrummaster said, the developer shall go up: behold, I have delivered the user stories into the board.
And in their terminal Git shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou stash thy commits against a repo.
Therefore being justified by tests, we have peace with merges.
Thou shall obey the 0b1010 commandments.
Thou shall have no other branchs before Master.
Thou shall not make bugs.
Thou shall not take the name of the /dev/null/ in vain.
Remember the Epoch day, to keep it holy.
Honor your HEAD and your HEAD.
Thou shall not rm -rf /.
Thou shall not commit redundancy.
Thou shall not buffer overflow.
Thou shall not bear false witness against your tests.
Thou shall contribute to OSS.
